Hey, I’m Raj—Master’s in Info Systems and Security, network nerd at heart. This project’s a simple way to check your home network’s health without writing a single line of code. It’s all about spotting weak spots—like open ports or slow devices—using free tools. No fancy stuff, just practical digging!
